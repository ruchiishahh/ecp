							<h2>Special Skills</h2>
							<p>Some of the special skills that</br> make me qualified to be a Program Manager.</p>

								<h2>Leadership Skills<span class="image left"><img src="images/pspeaking.jpg" alt="" /></span></h2>
								<p>Program Managers anticipate a lot of special skills, most importantly, leadership skills. By participating in many clubs on campus and gaining leadership positions I have been able to learn how to lead various groups of people. Overall, I am an officer and have leadership positions in: FBLA, ASB, Speech & Debate, Upcycling, Girls Who Code, and Women in Tech. Through each and every one of these positions, I have been able to lead and organize events for members. As a result, I have attained the leadership skills needed to be a successful Program Manager and believe that I can do well in this profession because of this skill. </p>

								<h2>Communication Skills<span class="image right"><img src="images/em.png" alt="" /></span></h2>
								<p>As the Leadership Associate for Cupertino FBLA, I learned different ways to communicate with a variety of different audiences. By contacting FBLA members via email, facebook, instagram, and other social media platforms twice a week, I have been able to effectively and accurately convey information about meetings’ time, date, and location. Additionally, I was able to create presentations that were concise and included all the relevant information that was needed for each project, community service opportunity, competition events, or business tour. Moreover, I was in charge of checking any incoming and sending any outgoing emails to members for clarification, questions, concerns, etc. As a result, I was able to develop robust communication skills. I believe that I would be able to apply these communication skills as a Program Manager because I would be able to clearly and effectively communicate with my fellow Project Managers and assign tasks in the most convenient and straightforward way possible.</p>

								<h2>Public Speaking Skills</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/gradspeaker.jpg" alt="" /></span>Throughout my many high school experiences as well as middle school experiences, I have learned how to public speak in front of major audiences. I demonstrated this skill by being the Hyde Middle School Graduation Speaker. Amidst my graduation class of 2014 and their families and friends, I was given the honor to speak about our journey through middle school. In addition to just this experience, I also demonstrated this skill of public speaking at Speech & Debate Tournaments where I performed ten minute memorized speeches. Both of these experiences have made me a better public-speaker and make me more qualified to be a Program Manager, as being a Program Manager requires strong public speaking skills to communicate and present information to their fellow co-workers. </p>

								<h2>Personal Organization Skills</h2>
								<p>As a Think Tank Intern, I learned a lot about how to organize paperwork both physically and online. This experience has provided me to organizational skills which I could apply to almost everything whether it be organizing my week’s schedule and important papers/files or project executions as a Program Manager. This skill will help me be a successful Program Manager as I’ll be more prone to an overwhelming workload and will be able to learn how to organize it in a way that will allow for my project managers to approach it in the most convenient way possible.</p>
