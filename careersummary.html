							<h2>Career Research Summary</h2>
							<p>The guidelines of a  </br> professional Program Manager.</p>
						</header>
						<section class="wrapper style5">
							<div class="inner">

								<h2>Description</h2>
								<p>Program managers maintain an important occupation within an organization’s project management group. Instead of managing individual projects, program managers coordinate teams working on similar projects and oversee their progress. For instance, in a technology related company, program managers might supervise works to develop a new suite of accounting software. Program managers collaborate with members of an organization’s senior management team to establish the overall strategy and objectives for a group of projects. They aim to align the outcome of the projects with the organization’s overarching business goals. Program managers reach out to the project managers and explain the strategy to ensure that individual project goals align with the strategy. </p>

								<p>To ensure project teams have the resources they need, program managers decide budgets and allocate people and technical resources to individual teams. Additionally, they rank and determine priorities. In order to reduce waste and costs, they identify tasks that are common to a number of projects and ensure that teams do not duplicate work. Program managers review the skills available within the project teams and arrange any necessary training to improve performance. Program managers also set deadlines to ensure that projects are focused. To obtain the information they need to coordinate and monitor progress across all projects, program managers establish a formal reporting structure.</p>

								<h2>Skills & Education</h2>
								<p>Program managers must have a concrete background in project management. They must also have fantastic written and oral communication skills and have both leadership and teamwork skills. Other valuable skills under this career include being detail oriented, working well under pressure, having organizational skills, being able to multi-task, and administering budgets across multiple projects. </p>

								<p>Regarding the education requirements, a minimum of a bachelor’s degree is mandatory for aspiring project managers. Most jobs in this field, require a business degree or with the addition of a degree in a specific field. For instance, a program management position in the environment sector may require a bachelor’s degree in biology or earth science. Many experienced program managers also have the opportunity to be eligible for a Project Management Professional credential, which necessitates a high school diploma or bachelor’s degree, 35 hours of coursework in project management and 3-5 years of experience. This credential can increase the applicant’s chance in obtaining jobs, but is not required in pursuing a career in Program Management.</p>

								<hr />

								<h2>Money/Salary</h2>
								<p>According to glassdoor, as of December 25th, 2016, the national average salary for a Program Manager is about $103,124. The median annual salary ranges from between $105,072-$140,220 depending on various factors. In the San Jose, CA Area, my current residence, the average salary is $106,230. </p>

								<hr />

								<h2>Future Job Outlook & Advancement</h2>
								<p>Once many program managers establish their career, there are a number of different jobs that project managers may pursue. These jobs include chief operating officer (COO) and a senior management role that falls under various different titles depending on the company and the industry. Moving into the COO for many program managers with at least 10 years of experience is fairly easy and smooth. Earning a Master of Business Administration, or MBA may be a good idea in attaining this position. The transition to this role inevitably includes an increase in responsibility and also a substantial increase in pay. The transition to a senior management role is also a significant promotion that results in not only increased responsibility, but also an increased salary. </p>
