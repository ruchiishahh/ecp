								<h2>School Activities</h2>
								<h4><span class="image right"><img src="images/fblapres.jpg" alt="" /></span>Local FBLA Chapter Involvement</h4>
								<!--
								<p>In my past three years as a member of Cupertino High School's FBLA, I have significantly contributed to the chapter. All of my contributions as well as officer positions demonstrate my leadership, organization, and team-work skills, which are all crucial for the program management profession.</p> -->

								<p>

									<ol>
												<li> <b>Chapter President (2017 - 2018)</b></li>
													<ul>
														<li style="margin-left: 40px"> In the upcoming school year, I will be serving as my chapter's President. After 6 years of dedication and involvement in FBLA I finally have been given the opportunity to conclude my last year in FBLA by serving as President to lead my chapter to sucess. I will be in charge of hosting weekly member and officer meetings and supervising a 20-person officer team. I can't wait to see the achievements and the goals I reach throughout next school year. </li>

													</ul>

												<li> <b>Competitions Officer (2016 - 2017)</b></li>
													<ul type="disc">
														<li style="margin-left: 40px">

														This position has allowed for me to learn how to lead about 300 Cupertino FBLA members to section, state, and national level competitions. Throughout this leadership occupation, I have been able to lead weekly study sessions, mock-competitions, and speak in front of a large audience of competitors. All the competitors rely on me for further guidance in their competitions and providence of resources. With this experience, I have developed thorough leadership skills as well as organizational skills.</li>

													</ul>
												<!--
												<li><b> Partnership with Business Committee Member (2016 - 2017) </b></li>
													<ul>
														<li style="margin-left: 40px">As a committee member for our annual Partnership with Business Project, I have gained both skills in being detail oriented and working with team-mates. In this committee, our chapter collaborated with Chegg, an educational prep center, to promote their services as well as provide another source of education to Cupertino High School students. Personally, I worked with my fellow committee members to create the project report, make and promote surveys, and craft promotional flyers to post around campus. Through this occupation, I was able to learn how to collaborate with others and be detail oriented to easily convey information. </li>

													</ul>
												
												<li><b>Leadership Associate/Auxiliary Officer (2015 - 2016)</b></li>
													<ul>
														<li style="margin-left: 40px">This position has taught me several techniques, but most importantly, this role made me a more detail-oriented individual. In this occupation, I was responsible for sending our local chapterâ€™s reminder and debrief emails and for making the presentations for weekly meetings. Furthermore, in this role, I worked with other officers including the President, Vice President, and Secretary to assist in any major projects they executed. Overall, this position is beneficial for my career as a program manager because I attained not only leadership skills, but also team-work skills.</li>

							<h3>Other Helpful Leadership Positions</h3>
							<!-- <p>In addition to my chapter involvement, I have had the opportunities to gain many experiences needed to succeed as a program manager. Some of the skills I have acquired through these leadership positions include being able to lead a group of people, monitoring money, and oral/written skills.</p> -->
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/s&d.jpg" alt="" /></span>

												<li><b>Upcycling Treasurer (2016 - 2017)</b></li>
													<ul>
														<li style="margin-left: 40px">As a treasurer of Upcycling, a current club on campus, I have gained a lot of experience in administering budgets and supervising money accounts. In order to raise money for materials and activities, I held many fundraisers to gain money for our club. These fundraisers include: Krispy Kreme, Pieology, and selling corsages and boutonnieres for Junior Prom. This experience has allowed for me to learn how to monitor money and thus is beneficial to my career as a program manager as I will have experience in the administering budgets aspect of it. </li>

													</ul>

							
												<li><b>Speech & Debate Original Oratory Captain (2015 - 2016)</b></li>
													<ul>
														<li style="margin-left: 40px">As the original oratory captain, I have developed excellent written and oral skills which are crucial abilities needed for the program manager occupation. I personally attend tournaments and gave ten minute self-written memorized speeches and trained 15-20 other Speech & Debate members for tournaments. This occupation allowed for me to become a better writer and speaker as well as gain leadership skills.  </li>

													</ul>

												<li><b>Girls Who Code Founder (2015 - Present)</b></li>
													<ul>
														<li style="margin-left: 40px">After establishing the first-ever Girls Who Code chapter at Cupertino High School, I have definitely gained both the leadership and technological skills needed to be an IT Program Manger. By working with other girls every other week to go over material, and practice coding, I have become more adept to programs like Java, HTML, etc. I believe that this will be helpful for my future as an IT Manager because it has helped me develop a concrete background in the technology and computer science field.</li>
